		Department of Computer Science
	</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to the Department of Computer Science. The department offers BS, MS, and PhD programs in Computer Science; MS programs in Software Engineering, Information Systems, and Information Security and Assurance; and a BS program in Applied Computer Science with various concentrations. The department also offers concentrations in the inter-disciplinary MS in Data Analytics Engineering and the PhD in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.
	</p>
	<p>
		Faculty in the department have research interests in networking, architecture, parallel and distributed computing, performance evaluation, software engineering, multimedia, graphics and visualization, databases, software engineering, data mining, security, information systems, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Department is part of the Volgenau School of Engineering at George Mason University. 
	</p>
	<h2>
	Masters Programs
	</h2>
	<p>
		The department offers a wide range of masters programs: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering. The Department also offers additional MS certificates in a variety of topics; course work toward the certificates can be used for credit toward various Masters programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon and evening to accommodate the professionally employed students. Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full- time degree-seeking students. Appropriate courses may be transferred, with advisor approval, into the degree program.
	</p>
	<p>
		Undergraduate students in CS or IT at George Mason University may also enroll in an accelerated MS as part of their BS degree. For more information, see the links at right.

					<h4>
					Admission Requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
					Admission is competitive among students who fulfil admission requirements for graduate study at the Computer Science Department of George Mason University. Students seeking admission to the M.S. in Computer Science program must satisfy the following requirements: 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Fulfil admission requirements for graduate study at George Mason University.
						</li>
						<li>
							Hold a baccalaureate degree, preferably with a major in a technical field such as computer science, mathematics, physics, engineering, or information systems; and have taken Data Structures (CS 310), Formal Methods and Models (CS 330), and Computer Systems Architecture including Assembly Programming (CS 367 and CS 465) or equivalent courses. Students should have completed one year of mathematics beyond first-year calculus, including a substantial course in discrete mathematics (e.g., MATH 125). Students with some deficiencies in preparation may be admitted provisionally pending completion of foundation courses in mathematics or computer science.
						</li>
						<li>
							Have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 for the last two years of undergraduate work.
						</li>
						<li>
						Submit transcripts of all post-secondary education, a self-evaluation form (the form is included in the on-line application package), two letters of recommendation, and an official GRE General test score report.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

			<h3>
			Masters of Science in Information Security and Assurance
			</h3>
			<p>
				This program satisfies the dual needs of preparing graduates to (1) fill the need for information security and assurance professionals to work in a wide variety of capacities to protect the information systems of different types of organizations, and to support the nationâ€™s information infrastructure and (2) conducting advanced research and in information security and assurance. Consequently, the degree provides technical knowledge and skills to understand information security, and provides specialized theoretical knowledge and experimental experience.
			</p>
		
			<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>
					Required Core Courses (9 credits)
				</h4>
				<p>
					To provide the necessary background and fundamentals of information systems security and assurance, the program has three courses that are required of all students:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					ISA 562 Information Security Theory and Practice
					</li>
					<li>
					ISA 656 Network Security
					</li>
					<li>
					INFS 612 Principles and Practice of Communication Networks OR CS 555 - Computer Communications and Networking
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

			<h3>
			Masters of Science in Information Systems
			</h3>
			<p>
			This professional degree program focuses on the technical, managerial and policy issues associated with designing, building and maintaining information systems in organizations. Data, information and knowledge are crucial to the modern enterprise, and the MS in Information Systems (MSIS) program addresses both the theoretical and engineering aspects of specifying, designing, implementing and managing large-scale information systems.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
			<h4>
			The goals of the MSIS are as follows:
			</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
				to provide a high-quality program that allows students with diverse baccalaureate and professional backgrounds to obtain an MS degree in Information Systems
				</li>
				<li>
				to provide a technical body of knowledge that will allow students to analyze, design, deploy, maintain and manage information systems in large organizations, e.g., industry, government, and non-profits
				</li>
				<li>
				to provide a course of study that allows professionals to pursue either a technical or a managerial approach to information systems
				</li>
				
			</ol>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>
			Masters of Science in Software Engineering
			</h3>
			<p>
			The Master of Science in Software Engineering provides specialized knowledge and experience in developing and modifying large, complex software systems. It emphasizes technical and management aspects of the software engineering process. Software engineering is an established discipline based on requirement analysis, design, construction, testing, maintenance, economics, and management issues of software engineering. A pragmatic approach to problem solving is the hallmark of a software engineer. Software engineers are concerned with the theoretical and practical aspects of technology, cost, and social impact of software systems that are both effective and efficient.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to the general requirements of the university, the MS in Software Engineering requires a minimum of 30 graduate credits. The coursework is divided into three categories: a breadth requirement of 12 hours of core courses, a depth requirement of 9 hours of emphasis courses, and 9 hours of elective courses.
